# my_daily_balance Flutter skeleton

This folder contains a minimal Flutter project skeleton created inside the existing `my_daily_balance` workspace so you can start building the Flutter app here.

What was created:
- `pubspec.yaml` — basic dependencies and flutter section
- `lib/main.dart` — minimal MaterialApp with `HomePage`
- `web/index.html` — minimal (for web target)
- `android/README.md` and `ios/README.md` — placeholders for native platform folders
- `.gitignore` — common Flutter ignore entries

How to use (if you have Flutter installed):

1. Open a terminal in this folder:

   cd my_daily_balance\flutter_app

2. Get packages and run:

   flutter pub get
   flutter run

You can target a device or web (e.g., `-d chrome`).
